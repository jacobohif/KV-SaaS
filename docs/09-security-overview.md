# 9. Security Documentation

## **Introduction: Security Philosophy and Framework**

This document aims to comprehensively describe the security governance framework for the multi-tenant SaaS platform. Our security philosophy is rooted in the principles of **Defense in Depth, Least Privilege, Secure by Default,** and **Shifting Security Left**. Through systematic threat modeling, a secure development lifecycle, and an incident response plan, we ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the platform and all tenant data.

## **1. Threat Modeling**

We use the **STRIDE** model to proactively identify and assess potential threats, which in turn guides the design of our security controls.

*   **Spoofing**: *An attacker impersonates a legitimate user or component.*
    *   **Mitigation**: Strong password policies, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), JWT-based session management, strict API key authentication.

*   **Tampering**: *An attacker maliciously modifies data or code.*
    *   **Mitigation**: Strict validation of all inputs, encoding of all outputs, database transactions, code signing, API request signing, data-at-rest encryption.

*   **Repudiation**: *A user denies having performed an action.*
    *   **Mitigation**: Detailed audit logs (the `audit_logs` table) that record the actor, time, and content of all critical operations.

*   **Information Disclosure**: *Sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized parties.*
    *   **Mitigation**: **Strict multi-tenant data isolation (RLS)**, encryption in transit (TLS), encryption at rest, fine-grained RBAC permission controls, not logging sensitive data.

*   **Denial of Service**: *An attacker makes a service unavailable to legitimate users.*
    *   **Mitigation**: DDoS protection from cloud providers, API rate limiting, resource quota management, horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA).

*   **Elevation of Privilege**: *A low-privilege user gains high-privilege capabilities.*
    *   **Mitigation**: Strict RBAC checks, re-verification of user identity before performing sensitive operations, principle of least privilege.

## **2. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (Secure SDLC)**

We integrate security activities into every stage of software development.

    end
    subgraph "Develop"

    subgraph "Test"
        C --> D[QA Testing<br>+ Dynamic Analysis (DAST)];

    subgraph "Deploy/Operate"
        D --> E[Deploy<br>+ Vulnerability Scanning] --> F[Operate<br>+ Penetration Testing<br>+ Continuous Monitoring];
    end
    F --> A;
```

*   **Design Phase**: Threat modeling is mandatory to identify potential risks and design mitigation measures.
*   **Coding Phase**:
    *   The CI pipeline integrates **SAST** (like `Clippy`) and **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** (like `cargo-audit`) to automatically scan code and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Testing Phase**:
    *   QA test cases must include the **multi-tenant isolation and permission testing scenarios** defined in our "Testing Documents."
    *   The CI pipeline can integrate **DAST** tools (like OWASP ZAP) to dynamically scan the testing environment.
*   **Operations Phase**:
    *   Periodically (at least annually), engage a third-party organization for comprehensive **penetration testing**.
    *   24/7 security monitoring and incident response.

## **3. Core Security Controls**

#### **3.1 Application Security**
*   **Authentication**: Strong password policy + MFA + Argon2/bcrypt hashing with salt.
*   **Session Management**: Use RS256-signed JWTs with reasonable expiration times.
*   **Access Control**: **Row-Level Security (RLS) based on `tenant_id`** is the cornerstone of data isolation. A strict **RBAC** model is used for intra-tenant permission control.
*   **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injection, XSS, etc. Apply type, size, and virus scanning restrictions to file uploads.

#### **3.2 Infrastructure and Data Security**
*   **Network**: VPC isolation + strict firewall rules + WAF/DDoS protection.
*   **Secrets Management**: Use **HashiCorp Vault** or **AWS KMS** to centrally manage all keys, passwords, and certificates.
*   **Data Encryption**: All data must be encrypted **in transit (TLS 1.2+)** and **at rest**.

## **4. Incident Response Plan**

We follow the NIST framework to establish a six-phase incident response process.

1.  **Preparation**:
    *   **Goal**: Ensure the team and tools are ready.
    *   **Activities**: Establish a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT); conduct regular incident response drills; prepare communication templates (internal/external).

2.  **Identification**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that a security incident has occurred.
    *   **Activities**: Alerts from monitoring systems (Prometheus, Alertmanager); anomalies detected by ops/dev personnel; user reports. Immediately create an incident War Room and assign an Incident Commander.

3.  **Containment**:
    *   **Goal**: Limit the scope of the incident and prevent it from spreading.
    *   **Activities**: Isolate the affected systems (e.g., remove from load balancer); disable compromised accounts; block malicious IP addresses.

4.  **Eradication**:
    *   **Goal**: Completely remove the root cause of the threat.
    *   **Activities**: Perform root cause analysis (RCA); remove malware; patch vulnerabilities; reset all related credentials.

5.  **Recovery**:
    *   **Goal**: Restore the system to normal operation.
    *   **Activities**: Restore data from clean backups; gradually bring the patched systems back online; continuously monitor to ensure the threat has not reappeared.

6.  **Lessons Learned**:
    *   **Goal**: Review and improve.
    *   **Activities**: Conduct a detailed post-mortem within 1-2 weeks after the incident. Write a report documenting the timeline, impact, root cause, and improvement measures, and track the implementation of these measures.
