## **Part 2: Compliance Technical Implementation Mapping**

This section maps key regulatory requirements to specific product features and technical implementations, serving as a to-do list for the development team.

| Requirement (Regulation) | Core Concept | Feature Implementation | Technical Implementation Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GDPR Art. 15** | **Right to Access** | Provide a "Download My Data" button in the "Personal Settings" page. | A backend API collects all personal data for the user and packages it into a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON) for download. |
| **GDPR Art. 17** | **Right to Erasure** | Provide a "Delete My Account" button in "Account Settings," with a confirmation step. | A backend API triggers a workflow to soft-delete or hard-delete user data and ensures removal from all third-party services (e.g., mailing lists). |
| **GDPR Art. 20** | **Data Portability** | Functionally similar to the "Right to Access," ensure the exported data is in a structured, common format. | Export as JSON or CSV. |
| **GDPR Art. 32** | **Security of Processing** | Site-wide mandatory HTTPS; database encryption at rest; strong password policy; MFA. | Configure TLS certificates at the infrastructure level; enable cloud provider's database encryption features; use Argon2 for password hashing on the backend. |
| **GDPR Art. 33** | **Data Breach Notification** | Establish an internal security incident response process and alerting mechanism. | The incident response plan defined in the "Operations Documentation" ensures analysis and reporting can be completed within 72 hours. |
| **CCPA/CPRA** | **Right to Opt-Out** | Provide a "Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information" link in the website footer. | Clicking the link sets a specific cookie or a flag in the user's account to record their choice, and ensures that advertising and analytics scripts respect this choice. |

## **Part 3: Compliance Implementation Recommendations**

*   **Hire Legal Counsel**: **This is the most important step.** A professional legal counsel must finalize all legal documents.
*   **Data Mapping Inventory**: Maintain a detailed internal data inventory that records:
    *   What personal data is processed?
    *   Where does it come from?
    *   Why is it used?
    *   Where is it stored?
    *   How long is it retained?
    *   With whom is it shared?
*   **Privacy by Design**: When designing new features, a privacy impact assessment must be conducted, and compliance requirements must be part of the feature acceptance criteria.
*   **Employee Training**: Regularly train all employees on data protection and security awareness.
*   **Continuous Monitoring & Review**: Laws are constantly changing. A responsible person should be designated to monitor regulatory updates and adjust the product and legal documents accordingly.
