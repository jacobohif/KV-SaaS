# 6. Project Management Documents

This document defines the processes, roles, tools, and communication mechanisms for the multi-tenant SaaS platform development project to ensure efficient team collaboration and timely, high-quality project delivery.

---

### **1. Team Roles & Responsibilities**

To ensure a smooth agile process, team roles are divided as follows:

*   **Product Owner**:
    *   **Core Responsibility**: Responsible for the business value of the product.
    *   **Specific Tasks**:
        *   Define the product vision and features.
        *   Manage and maintain the Product Backlog and determine its priority.
        *   Represent the interests of end-users and business stakeholders.
        *   Accept the completed work in the Sprint Review.

*   **Scrum Master**:
    *   **Core Responsibility**: Ensure the correct execution of the Scrum process; a "servant-leader" for the team.
    *   **Specific Tasks**:
        *   Facilitate Scrum meetings (Planning, Stand-up, Review, Retrospective).
        *   Remove any impediments the team encounters during a sprint.
        *   Protect the team from external distractions, ensuring they can focus on their work.
        *   Act as a coach for the team, helping them to continuously improve.

*   **Development Team**:
    *   **Core Responsibility**: Deliver a high-quality, potentially shippable increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.
    *   **Specific Tasks**:
        *   A cross-functional team including all necessary roles like frontend, backend, testing, UI/UX, etc.
        *   Estimate work and commit to the Sprint Backlog during the Sprint Planning meeting.
        *   Perform software design, development, testing, and documentation.
        *   Synchronize progress and issues in the Daily Stand-up.

### **2. Collaboration Toolchain**

To ensure information synchronization and process standardization, the team will use the following tools:

*   **Version Control**: **Git**, with code hosted on **GitHub** or **GitLab**.
*   **Task Management**: **Jira** (recommended) or **GitHub Issues**. Used to manage user stories, tasks, and defects.
*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: **GitHub Actions** (recommended) or **GitLab CI/CD**.
*   **Communication & Collaboration**: **Slack** (recommended) or **Microsoft Teams**. For daily communication and automated notifications.
*   **Documentation Hub**: **Confluence**, **Notion**, or directly using **Markdown files** within the project repository (like this document).
*   **Design Collaboration**: **Figma**. For UI/UX design and prototype delivery.

### **3. Project Plan**

We will use the Agile/Scrum methodology, dividing the project into multiple phases and sprints.

#### **3.1 Project Phases**

*   **Phase 1: MVP Core Function Development (Est. 3-4 months)**
    *   **Goal**: Complete the most critical SaaS features to allow the first batch of seed users to go live.
    *   **Scope**:
        *   **Backend**: Build the microservices foundation, complete authentication and tenant management services.
        *   **Database**: Design and implement the core table structure, ensuring multi-tenant isolation.
        *   **Frontend**: Complete the customer portal's tenant registration, login, user management, and subscription management (integrating with payment gateways like Stripe).
        *   **Core Business**: Implement 1-2 of the most critical business features.
        *   **Infrastructure**: Set up the CI/CD pipeline and basic monitoring/logging systems.

*   **Phase 2: Feature Enhancement & Experience Optimization (Est. 2-3 months)**
    *   **Goal**: Enhance features and improve user experience based on MVP feedback.
    *   **Scope**:
        *   **Customer Portal**: Add branding settings, audit logs, and data import/export functions.
        *   **Core Business**: Expand with more business feature modules.
        *   **Admin Backend**: Develop an internal admin portal for tenant management and system monitoring.
        *   **Testing**: Improve automated test coverage.

*   **Phase 3: Expansion & Deepening (Ongoing)**
    *   **Goal**: Add advanced features, improve system performance and security.
    *   **Scope**:
        *   Third-party integrations (e.g., SSO, CRM).
        *   Advanced reporting and data analytics features.
        *   Performance optimization and security hardening.
        *   Develop new features based on market demand.

#### **3.2 Development Workflow**

We adopt a Git Flow-based branching model and a Kanban-style task flow to ensure code quality and transparency in the development process.

*   **Branching Model**:
    *   `main`: The main branch, always reflecting a production-ready state.
    *   `develop`: The development branch, integrating all completed features, serving as the pre-release branch for the next version.
    *   `feature/xxx`: Feature branches, where each new feature or user story is developed. Merged into `develop` upon completion.
    *   `hotfix/xxx`: Hotfix branches, used for urgent fixes on the `main` branch for production issues.

*   **Kanban Flow**:
    Each task (user story) will go through the following states:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[To Do] --> B[In Progress];
        B --> C[Code Review];
        C -- Needs Changes --> B;
        C -- Approved --> D[In Testing];
        D -- Failed --> B;
        D -- Passed --> E[Ready for Deploy];
        E --> F[Done];

        classDef state fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        class A,B,C,D,E,F state
    ```

#### **3.3 Definition of Done (DoD)**

"Done" means more than just "code complete." A user story is only considered **truly done** when it meets all the following criteria:

*   **Code Merged**: Feature code has passed Code Review and been merged into the `develop` branch.
*   **Unit Tests Passed**: All relevant unit tests have been written and passed, and code coverage meets the quality gate requirements.
*   **Integration Tests Passed**: All relevant API and integration tests have passed.
*   **E2E Tests Passed**: Relevant end-to-end test scenarios have passed.
*   **Documentation Updated**: If there are changes to the architecture, API, or user interface, the relevant technical documents and user manuals must be updated accordingly.
*   **Product Owner Acceptance**: The feature has been demonstrated to the PO in the Sprint Review and has been accepted.

#### **3.4 Scrum Events**

*   **Cycle**: Each sprint lasts for 2 weeks.
*   **Meetings**:
    *   **Sprint Planning**: At the beginning of the sprint, the team selects tasks from the Product Backlog and creates a sprint plan.
    *   **Daily Stand-up**: A 15-minute daily meeting to sync progress, plans, and impediments.
    *   **Sprint Review**: At the end of the sprint, demonstrate the "Done" work.
    *   **Sprint Retrospective**: An internal team meeting to reflect and continuously improve the work process.

### **4. Risk Management**

*   **Technical Risks**:
    *   **Risk**: A vulnerability in multi-tenant data isolation leads to a data breach.
        *   **Mitigation**: Use database RLS as the last line of defense; write rigorous automated test cases for verification; Code Reviews must include checks on `tenant_id` handling.
    *   **Risk**: Poor technology choices or architectural design cannot support future user growth.
        *   **Mitigation**: Adopt a cloud-native and microservices-ready architecture; conduct performance stress tests early in the project; choose mature technologies with active communities for critical components.

*   **Project Risks**:
    *   **Risk**: MVP scope creep leads to delivery delays.
        *   **Mitigation**: Strictly adhere to the MVP definition, with the Product Owner controlling requirement priorities. Any scope change must be evaluated.
    *   **Risk**: Team member turnover affects development progress.
        *   **Mitigation**: Maintain good documentation; promote pair programming and knowledge sharing to reduce single points of failure.

*   **Security Risks**:
    *   **Risk**: The platform is subjected to DDoS or other network attacks.
        *   **Mitigation**: Use DDoS protection and WAF services provided by cloud vendors; conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

### **5. Progress Reports**

*   **Reporting Cycle**: A progress report is issued every two weeks (at the end of each sprint).
*   **Report Content**:
    *   **Work Completed This Cycle**: List of completed user stories or features.
    *   **Work Planned for Next Cycle**: Brief description of the main goals for the next sprint.
    *   **Key Metrics**:
        *   **Burndown Chart**: Visualize task completion progress.
        *   **Automated Test Coverage**: Track code quality.
    *   **Issues & Impediments**: Record major difficulties encountered and the solutions taken or planned.
    *   **Risk Update**: Update the status of the risk list.
*   **Distribution**: All project stakeholders, including management, product, development, and testing teams.
